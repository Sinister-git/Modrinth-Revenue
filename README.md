# Modrinth-Revenue
This project is a web dashboard designed to display daily revenue data from the Modrinth platform. The dashboard pulls data from the official Modrinth API, processes it, and presents the total revenue, creator revenue, and Modrinth's share of the revenue in a clean, formatted table. The page automatically updates every hour usinga Python script.
